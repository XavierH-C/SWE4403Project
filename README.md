SWE4403 Design Pattern Project

	Farm management system designed to help farmers and ag professionals' input, store, and use nutrient information to improve their operations. The system must store user, farm, field, and sampling data in a relational database with maximum capacity to expand to include new features. A user could be a farmer, farm worker with one farm object or and agronomists, or retailer that services multiple farm objects. Each farm can have multiple geolocated fields, with harvests of different timeframes and crops, and nutrient status. Inputted nutrient sample or fertilizer application data must be stored by time and location. There are a couple data standards to follow, including the MODUS agricultural data standard as well as Candian, Californian, and EU data laws.
